## Project's Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN user is using a daily planner to create a schedule:
- When user opens the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- When user scrolls down, then user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
- When user views the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- When user clicks into a timeblock, then user can enter an event.
- When user clicks the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
- When user refreshes the page, then the saved events persist. 


## Technology Used
The website was built using HMTL and CSS programing languages. The JavaScript was used to trigger all actions associated with the Daily Activity Scheduler.
